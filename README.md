Price dripping is a type of dark pattern that occurs when a company advertises only part of a product's total cost to attract consumers and then waits to disclose additional mandatory charges until late in the buying process. This design strategy is meant to frustrate consumers' ability to compare prices and pressure them into agreeing to additional fees after they have already invested significant time in the buying process 3.

Consumers exposed to price dripping tend to spend about 20% more money and are 14% more likely to complete a transaction compared to other consumers. This is because the initial price presented seems reasonable, and the additional costs are hidden until the final stages of the purchase process, when it's harder for consumers to back out 3.

To illustrate, imagine you're buying a car. The dealership might initially show you the base price of the car, but then add on additional costs for things like insurance, maintenance, or delivery fees. These additional costs are "dripped" in over time, making the final price seem higher than it initially appeared.

Price dripping is a common dark pattern used by many businesses, and it can be particularly effective because it leverages the natural human tendency to commit to a purchase once we've spent time considering it. By the time we realize there are additional costs, we're more likely to go ahead with the purchase because we've already invested mental energy into it 3.
